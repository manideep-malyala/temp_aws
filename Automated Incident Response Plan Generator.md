# Automated Incident Response Plan Generator

**Complexity Level:** Medium
**Reasoning:** The power of this use case lies in advanced prompt engineering and internal orchestration ‚Äî not complex integrations. It leverages LLMs to generate structured IR plans using established frameworks like NIST 800-61. By using only AWS-native services (S3, Lambda, Bedrock Agents), the solution remains lightweight, portable, and hackathon-ready.

---

### **Core Concept:**

This system helps cybersecurity teams respond to live security incidents by dynamically generating a tailored, step-by-step **Incident Response (IR)** plan. Given a free-text threat description (e.g., ‚ÄúRansomware detected on finance server‚Äù), Bedrock Agents orchestrated through Lambda analyze the threat and build a structured IR checklist categorized by **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**.

---

### **Primary Objective:**

To reduce time-to-response and human error during a crisis by instantly creating an actionable IR playbook customized to the specific scenario.

---

### **Problem Statement:**

In real-world incidents, time is critical. Security teams struggle to create plans on the fly or rely on rigid playbooks. This can lead to:

* Incomplete actions (missing containment or comms steps)
* Delays in recovery
* Miscommunication between teams

An automated assistant that generates a plan in real time reduces chaos and ensures compliance with industry best practices.

### **The Multi-Agent Team: Roles and Responsibilities**

| Agent Name                   | Role                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incident Analyzer Agent**  | Extracts incident type, affected asset, and severity from the free-text input                |
| **Playbook Retriever Agent** | Queries a curated corpus of NIST-based documentation (stored in S3) relevant to the incident |
| **Plan Generator Agent**     | Synthesizes a full incident response plan based on retrieved procedures and threat context   |
| **Task Structurer Agent**    | Breaks down the plan into assignable tasks and outputs structured Markdown or JSON           |

### **Agent Toolkit: Associated Tools and Technologies**

| AWS Service   | Role |
| ------------- | ---- |
| **Amazon S3** |      |

* `S3-IR-KnowledgeBase/`: Preloaded NIST 800-61 guidance, sample IR playbooks, and compliance docs in `.md` format
* `S3-IncidentRequests/`: Stores new incident descriptions submitted by users
* `S3-IR-Plans/`: Stores the generated incident response plans in `.json` and `.md` formats |
  \| **AWS Lambda**   |
* `IRPlanTriggerLambda`: Invoked when a new incident is uploaded
* `TextExtractorLambda`: Parses the input to identify critical incident parameters
* `PlanSaverLambda`: Stores the generated IR plan |
  \| **Bedrock Agents (Claude 3, GPT-4o)** |
* Handle entity extraction, document understanding, and structured output generation
* Reason across multiple retrieved documents to generate final checklist |

### **Workflow from the User‚Äôs Perspective**

1. **Step 1:**
   A security analyst submits a new case:

   ```
   Incident: ‚ÄúSuspicious lateral movement detected across domain controllers. Possible privilege escalation. Affected system: AD01.‚Äù
   ```

   This gets uploaded as a file to `S3-IncidentRequests/new_case.txt`.

2. **Step 2:**
   `IRPlanTriggerLambda` is triggered by the S3 event.

3. **Step 3:**
   It passes the text to Bedrock's **Incident Analyzer Agent**, which extracts:

   ```json
   {
     "incident_type": "Privilege Escalation",
     "affected_asset": "Domain Controller AD01",
     "risk_level": "High"
   }
   ```

4. **Step 4:**
   The **Playbook Retriever Agent** queries the documents in `S3-IR-KnowledgeBase/` and selects relevant content such as:

   * Containment strategies for AD attacks
   * Eradication steps for privilege escalation
   * Notification and documentation requirements (from NIST 800-61)

5. **Step 5:**
   The **Plan Generator Agent** composes a plan like:

   ```
   INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN ‚Äì Case ID: IR-230714-01  
   Phase 1 ‚Äì Containment  
   ‚úÖ Step 1.1: Isolate Domain Controller AD01 from network.  
   ‚úÖ Step 1.2: Disable any recently created admin accounts.  

   Phase 2 ‚Äì Eradication  
   ‚úÖ Step 2.1: Perform forensic snapshot of affected system.  
   ‚úÖ Step 2.2: Revert AD01 to a known good snapshot if possible.  

   Phase 3 ‚Äì Recovery  
   ‚úÖ Step 3.1: Restore services from backups.  
   ‚úÖ Step 3.2: Monitor privileged account activity for 72 hours.  

   Communications  
   ‚úÖ Step 4.1: Notify CISO and Compliance Team.  
   ‚úÖ Step 4.2: Draft internal status update.
   ```

6. **Step 6:**
   The **Task Structurer Agent** saves this checklist as both Markdown and structured JSON into `S3-IR-Plans/IR-230714-01.md` and `IR-230714-01.json`.

### **Sample Bedrock Prompt: Plan Generator Agent**

```txt
You are an Incident Response Advisor.

You are given:
1. An incident summary
2. Extracted incident type and affected assets
3. A corpus of guidelines from NIST 800-61 and organizational playbooks

Generate a structured Incident Response Plan with these phases:
- Containment
- Eradication
- Recovery
- Communication

Each phase should have 2‚Äì4 steps with actionable instructions. Format as a numbered checklist.
```
