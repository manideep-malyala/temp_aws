# Automated Threat Intelligence Fusion and Reporting

### 🔹 Complexity Level: Low

### 🔹 Reasoning:

This use case relies on **well-known APIs**, **standard LLM tasks** like summarization and entity extraction, and a **linear agent flow**. It's ideal for hackathon teams, especially beginners, looking to produce high-ROI outcomes with minimal infrastructure complexity.

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

This system **automates OSINT collection**, applies **intelligent filtering and summarization**, and generates **structured threat reports**, giving security analysts a concise daily briefing without manual overhead.

---

## 🎯 Primary Objective

To convert fragmented, noisy threat data from multiple open sources into a **clean, unified intelligence report** delivered automatically to analysts — reducing response delays and improving situational awareness.

---

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Threat data is spread across blogs, forums, tweets, and Telegram chats. Analysts **waste hours triaging**, deduplicating, and summarizing it — delaying threat visibility and making defenses reactive instead of proactive.

## 🧠 Multi-Agent Team: Roles and Responsibilities

| Agent                           | Responsibility                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 **OSINT Collector Agent**    | Monitors predefined OSINT sources (RSS, Twitter, Telegram, Reddit) and scrapes or fetches new content.                |
| 🗂 **Triage & Filtering Agent** | Uses keyword rules and LLM classification to determine relevance, eliminate duplicates, and filter noise.             |
| ✍️ **Summarizer Agent**         | Applies entity extraction (e.g., IOCs, threat actors, CVEs) and summarization to reduce the content to core insights. |
| 🧾 **Report Formatting Agent**  | Generates a daily report (Markdown, PDF, or Word) using a structured layout with headings and bullet points.          |

## 🛠 Agent Toolkit: Tools and Technologies

| Agent                   | Tools                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OSINT Collector Agent   | `feedparser`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, Twitter API, Telegram API             |
| Triage Agent            | LLMs (e.g., `GPT-3.5`), vector DBs like `FAISS` or `ChromaDB` for de-duplication |
| Summarizer Agent        | `GPT-4`, `Claude 3` with custom prompts for threat intelligence                  |
| Report Formatting Agent | `python-docx`, `fpdf2`, `Markdown2PDF`, or HTML-to-PDF conversion tools          |

## 🧭 Workflow from the User's Perspective

1. Security analyst inputs a list of OSINT sources into the system.
2. The system runs in the background, scanning sources hourly or daily.
3. Each day, the user receives a **polished, human-readable threat intel briefing** by email or chat (Slack/Teams).
4. Example output:

### Example Summarization Prompt for LLM:

```
You are a threat intelligence analyst. Given the following article, extract:
- Threat actor names
- Malware names
- TTPs or techniques
- Target industries or countries
Then summarize the key threat in 3–4 bullet points.
```
