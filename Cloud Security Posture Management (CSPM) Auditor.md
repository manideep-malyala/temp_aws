# Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Auditor

**Complexity Level:** Medium

 **Reasoning:** This use case is both practical and achievable using well-documented AWS APIs (e.g., `boto3`). Complexity lies in aligning real-time cloud inventory with compliance frameworks like CIS Benchmarks and converting LLM outputs into reliable remediation steps. The use of Bedrock Agents makes this orchestration seamless and powerful for rapid prototyping.

---

### **Core Concept**

An automated, multi-agent system that audits an AWS account for misconfigurations, compares resource configurations against the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, and generates a human-readable, prioritized report with detailed remediation guidance.

---

### **Primary Objective**

To continuously monitor and audit AWS environments for risky configurations and compliance violations, reducing the likelihood of data breaches and supporting proactive security posture management.

---

### **Problem Statement**

Modern AWS environments are complex, distributed, and dynamic. Manual audits are time-consuming and often out of date. Common misconfigurations (e.g., open S3 buckets, overly permissive IAM roles, unencrypted volumes) are a primary vector for cloud data breaches.

## 🧠 **The Multi-Agent Team: Roles and Responsibilities**

| Agent Name                         | Role                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Infrastructure Discovery Agent** | Uses AWS SDK to inventory all relevant cloud resources (S3, EC2, IAM, Security Groups, etc.) |
| **Compliance Check Agent**         | Matches configurations against security rules from CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark             |
| **Remediation Advisor Agent**      | Uses LLM to generate step-by-step fix instructions                                           |
| **Report Generation Agent**        | Builds the final report (HTML/PDF/Markdown) grouped by criticality                           |

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Infrastructure Discovery   | **AWS Lambda + Boto3** (e.g., `list_buckets`, `describe_security_groups`)      |
| Compliance Rules Knowledge | **S3 (cis-rules.json)** + **ChromaDB vector store** (for retrieval by Bedrock) |
| Agentic Reasoning          | **Bedrock Agent (Claude 3 / GPT-4o)**                                          |
| Remediation Plan Generator | **LLM prompt pipeline** (Bedrock API)                                          |
| Report Creation & Delivery | **Lambda + fpdf / Markdown + S3 Upload + SNS**                                 |

## 🧭 **Workflow from the User’s Perspective**

1. **Start Audit**
   Security Engineer launches the tool via a web interface or CLI, providing **read-only IAM credentials**.

2. **Discovery**

   * `DiscoveryLambda` invokes Boto3 SDK to fetch cloud inventory:

     * S3 Buckets → `list_buckets` + `get_bucket_acl`
     * Security Groups → `describe_security_groups`
     * IAM Policies → `list_roles`, `get_role_policy`
   * A JSON representation of the infrastructure is uploaded to `S3-CSPM-Raw/`.

3. **Compliance Checking**

   * `ComplianceLambda` triggers the **Compliance Check Agent**.
   * For each resource, the agent retrieves relevant CIS benchmark rules and checks if the config matches the expected values using Bedrock.
   * Example output:

     ```json
     {
       "resource": "s3://confidential-data-2024",
       "issue": "Public Read Access Enabled",
       "cis_control": "CIS 1.2.0 - Ensure all S3 buckets are private",
       "severity": "Critical"
     }
     ```

4. **Remediation Advice**

   * Each violation is sent to the **Remediation Advisor Agent**, which prompts Bedrock to produce:

     * Clear fix steps
     * CLI and Console instructions
     * Optional CloudFormation/Terraform patch

   Example:

   > **Fix:** Go to the S3 Console → Find `confidential-data-2024` → Permissions → Remove `AllUsers` group from Access Control List → Save.

5. **Report Generation**

   * All findings are passed to `ReportLambda`, which:

     * Categorizes findings by severity
     * Formats a final Markdown/HTML report
     * Uploads the report to `S3-CSPM-Reports/`
     * Optionally emails a link using SNS

---

### **Technical Deep Dive: Developer's Perspective**

* **Agent Communication Layer:**
  Each Lambda logs outputs to S3, which acts as the shared message bus for state transitions.

* **Compliance Check Example Prompt:**

  ```txt
  Given the following config:
  {
    "BucketName": "confidential-data-2024",
    "ACL": "public-read"
  }
  Does this violate CIS AWS Benchmark v1.2.0 section on S3 security?
  Return: Yes/No + Reason.
  ```

* **Remediation Prompt:**

  ```txt
  Provide a step-by-step guide (CLI and Console) to make S3 Bucket 'confidential-data-2024' private.
  ```
