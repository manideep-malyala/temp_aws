# Technology-to-Threat Profile Generator

---

## üéØ Target Audience

* Security analysts
* Developers and solution architects
* DevSecOps teams
* Security product evaluators

---

## üí° Core Concept

A user inputs the name of a technology (e.g., **Apache Struts**, **Jenkins**, or **Microsoft Exchange Server**). The system then generates a structured **Threat Profile** that summarizes:

* Major known vulnerabilities
* MITRE ATT\&CK techniques used by adversaries
* High-level security commentary for decision-making

This tool answers the critical question:

> ‚ÄúWe are deploying X ‚Äî how are attackers most likely to target us?‚Äù

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Primary Objective

To help technical teams **quickly understand the threat landscape** associated with a specific software product or technology stack by automating the collection and summarization of:

* Public CVE vulnerability data
* MITRE ATT\&CK TTP mappings
* Threat actor usage trends

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Statement

When choosing or deploying a technology, teams often **lack awareness** of:

* Its historical security weaknesses
* Common techniques adversaries use to exploit it

Gathering this data manually is **time-consuming**, scattered across:

* CVE/NVD databases
* MITRE ATT\&CK mappings
* Security blogs and threat reports

This tool automates the **search + retrieve + summarize** flow, saving hours of research.

## üß† The Multi-Agent Team: Roles and Responsibilities

### üîç 1. **Query Agent** ‚Äì *The Interpreter*

* **Task**: Takes user input (e.g., ‚ÄúJenkins‚Äù) and standardizes it for downstream agents
* **Function**:

  * Performs input normalization
  * Maps technology names to relevant CVE/NVD and MITRE search terms

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. **Vulnerability Research Agent** ‚Äì *The CVE Analyst*

* **Task**: Searches for **high-severity vulnerabilities**
* **Sources**:

  * NVD API (CVE 2.0)
  * CVSS ‚â• 7.0 filters
* **Output**: List of relevant CVEs with metadata:

  * CVE ID
  * Summary
  * Year
  * CVSS score

---

### üéØ 3. **TTP Research Agent** ‚Äì *The Threat Hunter*

* **Task**: Identifies MITRE ATT\&CK **tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** associated with the input technology
* **Source**:

  * MITRE ATT\&CK Navigator or site-specific scraping (e.g., `site:attack.mitre.org Jenkins`)
* **Output**:

  * ATT\&CK Technique IDs (e.g., T1059, T1505)
  * Technique names
  * Example threat actors or malware families, if available

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è 4. **Profile Synthesizer Agent** ‚Äì *The Intelligence Analyst*

* **Task**: Takes the raw CVE and TTP data and **summarizes it** into a coherent, formatted threat profile
* **Technology**:

  * Amazon Bedrock with GPT-4 or Claude
* **Output**:

  * Markdown or HTML summary
  * Executive-level interpretation
  * Optional export formats (PDF, JSON)

## üë§ Workflow from the User's Perspective

### Scenario:

A DevOps engineer is evaluating **Jenkins** for CI/CD.

### Steps:

1. They enter **‚ÄúJenkins‚Äù** into the tool.
2. The tool outputs a **Threat Profile**:

```markdown
# üõ†Ô∏è Technology: Jenkins

## üîì High-Impact Vulnerabilities
- **CVE-2018-1000861**: Remote code execution via Groovy script sandbox bypass (CVSS: 9.8)
- **CVE-2020-2100**: Denial of service due to unbounded resource usage (CVSS: 7.5)
- **CVE-2019-10389**: Cross-site scripting in plugin interface (CVSS: 7.4)

## üéØ Common ATT&CK Techniques
- **T1059 ‚Äì Command and Scripting Interpreter**  
  Attackers exploit Jenkins‚Äô Groovy script console to execute arbitrary commands.
  
- **T1505 ‚Äì Server Software Component**  
  Threat actors target Jenkins plugins to compromise internal workflows.

## üß† Summary
Jenkins is a frequent target for attackers due to its plugin architecture and script console. Misconfigured or outdated instances are especially vulnerable. Common attacks involve remote code execution and command injection through insecure plugin usage.
